		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am from White Plains, NY. Not everyone knows where every city is, so I usually say I'm from Westchester County, the county above NYC. That seems to give a better idea of where my location is. I guess the most common story to why I wanted to study computer science in college was my fascination with computers and the internet. I have the most vivid memories of using google and microsoft powerpoint for the first time on bulky box computers. That is why I'm grateful to my third grade teacher for introducing me to computers. I was excited to explore what the internet and computing had to offer, but I was also interested in what the future of technology was. I never played a lot of video games until middle school when I got my first xbox. Gaming became one of my hobbies. I believe in the idea of having three hobbies. A hobby of play, a hobby of work, and a hooby of exercise. Play is video games, work is coding, and exercise is running and the gym. I game every so often, but obviously college has taken up more time, and that is more important. I quickly realized there are some sacrifices you have to make, which is why I couldn't play as many games or lazily browse the internet. Anyways, I am Puerto Rican and Peruvian, and I love food. Food is everything. I'm not sure if this is weird, but my favorite foods are rice, potatoes, and beans. Maybe I can become a millionaire and combine these foods to make the tastiest dish known to man. I also want to learn how to cook. Cook well.</p>
