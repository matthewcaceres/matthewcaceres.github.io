		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am from White Plains, NY. It's in Westchester county, the county above NYC. I absolutely love White Plains for the people, places, and food. I wasn't a full fledged gamer until middle school when I got my first xbox. That is when I also gained great interest in the future of technology. Today I don't play as much games as I used to because of college, but I thoroughly enjoy Leage of Legends, Overwatch, and many single player games. Obviously coding is my other hobby. I look forward to what more I could learn in university in terms of Computer Science because I love a challenge. I also love food. Asian, Mexican, Spanish food, anything is fine with me. Anything with rice is even more fine. Furthermore, while I don't know what the future entails, I hope my love for computers and coding grow as I grow.</p>
